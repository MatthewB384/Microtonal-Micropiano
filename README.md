# Microtonal-Micropiano
This creates a very simple tkinter piano. I made this to play around with microtones

What are microtones? Microtones are the notes halfway in between the normal notes of a scale.
Between the standard notes c and c#, for example, there is the microtone c+. Microtones are
not commonly used in compositions, as they often clash with whole tones. I made this piano to
experiment with microtones and find out how they sound
